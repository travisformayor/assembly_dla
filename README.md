# DLA (Diffusion-Limited Aggregation) in Assembly 

## Overview
Diffusion-Limited Aggregation is an algorithm that can be used in generative art to create interesting and organic structures. It uses a simple concept of particles that randomly "wiggle" until they touch and stick to a larger structure of particles (aka the "aggregate"). This creates the effect of the aggregate appearing to diffuse through the limited field of particles, hence the name. This project implements a simple version of DLA in assembly code.
